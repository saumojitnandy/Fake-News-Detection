# Fake-News-Detection

Fake news detection involves the identification and analysis of false or misleading information presented as factual news. This process typically utilizes various techniques, including natural language processing, machine learning algorithms, and fact-checking methodologies, to assess the credibility and authenticity of news content. The goal is to distinguish between reliable information and deceptive or erroneous reports, thereby helping to mitigate the spread of misinformation and maintain the integrity of news dissemination platforms.
